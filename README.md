This GitHub repository showcases the python notebooks used to achieve the results seen in the thesis.

The files are as follows:

## Applying the full range of models
1. AdultAllModels.ipynb - the application of the full range of models to the Adult Income dataset
2. BankAllModels.ipynb - the application of the full range of models to the Bank dataset
3. COMPASAllModels.ipynb - the application of the full range of models to the COMPAS dataset

## Applying the original Decision Tree Model
4. AdultDecisionTree.ipynb - the application of the base decision tree model to the Adult Income dataset + analysis
5. BankDecisionTree.ipynb - the application of the base decision tree model to the Bank dataset + analysis
6. COMPASDecisionTree.ipynb - the application of the base decision tree model to the COMPAS dataset + analysis

## Sampling the dataset
7. AdultDecisionTreeSample.ipynb - applying a sampling technique to the Adult Income dataset to allow for better decision tree results
8. BankDecisionTreeSample.ipynb - applying a sampling technique to the Bank dataset to allow for better decision tree results
9. COMPASDecisionTreeSample.ipynb - applying a sampling technique to the COMPAS dataset to allow for better decision tree results

## Partitioning the dataset
10. AdultDecisionTreePartitioned.ipynb - partitioning the Adult Income dataset by protected category to highlight possible bias
11. BankDecisionTreePartitioned.ipynb - partitioning the Bank dataset by protected category to highlight possible bias
12. COMPASDecisionTreePartitioned.ipynb - partitioning the COMPAS dataset by protected category to highlight possible bias
