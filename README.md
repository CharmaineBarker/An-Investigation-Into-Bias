This GitHub repository showcases the python notebooks used to achieve the results seen in the thesis.

The files are as follows:

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. AdultInitial.ipynb - EDA into the Adult Income dataset (including plots and hypothesis testing)
2. BankInitial.ipynb - EDA into the Bank dataset (including plots and hypothesis testing)
3. COMPASInitial.ipynb -EDA into the COMPAS dataset (including plots and hypothesis testing)

## Applying the full range of models
4. AdultAllModels.ipynb - the application of the full range of models to the Adult Income dataset
5. BankAllModels.ipynb - the application of the full range of models to the Bank dataset
6. COMPASAllModels.ipynb - the application of the full range of models to the COMPAS dataset

## Applying the original Decision Tree Model
7. AdultDecisionTree.ipynb - the application of the base decision tree model to the Adult Income dataset + analysis (+ correlation heatmap)
8. BankDecisionTree.ipynb - the application of the base decision tree model to the Bank dataset + analysis (+ correlation heatmap)
9. COMPASDecisionTree.ipynb - the application of the base decision tree model to the COMPAS dataset + analysis (+ correlation heatmap)

## Sampling the dataset
10. AdultDecisionTreeSample.ipynb - applying a sampling technique to the Adult Income dataset to allow for better decision tree results
11. BankDecisionTreeSample.ipynb - applying a sampling technique to the Bank dataset to allow for better decision tree results
